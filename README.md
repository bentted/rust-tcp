# Rust TCP Server

**Rust TCP** is a single-threaded TCP server implemented entirely in **Rust**. This project provides a simple yet efficient example of how to handle TCP connections in a minimalistic and elegant way using Rust's standard library.

---

## Features

### üåê TCP Server
- Handles incoming TCP connections on a single thread.
- Demonstrates how to accept and process client requests.
- Provides a foundation for building more complex server applications.

### ‚ö° High Performance
- Written in Rust, ensuring memory safety and reliable performance.
- Lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for learning and experimentation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Minimalistic Design
- Focuses on simplicity to help developers understand core concepts of TCP communication.
- Clean and readable code structure.

## Repository Structure

| File/Directory | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Cargo.toml`   | Contains project metadata and Rust dependencies.                           |
| `Cargo.lock`   | Tracks exact versions of dependencies for reproducible builds.             |
| `main.rs`      | The main source file containing the implementation of the TCP server.      |

## How It Works

1. **Server Initialization**:
   - The server binds to a specified IP address and port.
   - It listens for incoming TCP connections.

2. **Connection Handling**:
   - Each incoming connection is accepted and processed on the main thread.
   - Demonstrates how to read and write data over a TCP stream.

3. **Message Exchange**:
   - The server sends and receives messages from the client.
   - Basic request-response mechanism to keep the implementation simple.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) on your system.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bentted/rust-tcp.git
   cd rust-tcp
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Start the server by running the `cargo run` command.
2. Use a TCP client (e.g., `telnet`, `nc`, or a custom Rust client) to connect to the server:
   ```bash
   telnet 127.0.0.1 <PORT>
   ```
   Replace `<PORT>` with the port number used by the server.

3. Interact with the server by sending messages, and observe its responses.

## Code Highlights

### `main.rs` - Core Implementation
The `main.rs` file demonstrates:
- How to bind to an address and port using Rust's `TcpListener`.
- Accepting incoming connections with `listener.accept()`.
- Reading and writing data using `TcpStream`.
